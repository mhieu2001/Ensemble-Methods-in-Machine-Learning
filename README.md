## Bagging 
In binary classification problems, predictions from models are often continuous values representing probabilities. A common threshold for converting these probabilities into binary predictions is 0.5. If the predicted probability is greater than or equal to 0.5, it is classified as the positive class; otherwise, it is classified as the negative class.
